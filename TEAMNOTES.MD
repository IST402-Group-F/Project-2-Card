**#In-class Participation**
10/14/2021
Our groups all have very similar elements (if not the exact same) that we have broken the learning cards into [icon, body, banner, scaffolding]. We all discussed how we are planning on taking pieces and molding from the template that was given to us in class. Additionally we all chose to separate work by components so each individual team member took a component to work on to spred the workload. We are all very early on in the process so we still have a lot of work to complete, but our next steps are to implement simple colors and work towards Sunday check-in.

# Team notes
This is for maintaining communication about your team's working meetings to "ship" the project.

### Meeting Date

#### What we'll do next


## Status check ins
These are dedicated status check-ins as this is a multi-week project
### Check-in 1
- Group met over the weekend forgot to update teamnotes
- Names (referenced from above except for last part) : pjc-icon, pjc-body, pjc-title, pjc-scaff
- planning to distribute work evenly, researching more about html slotted part
Elements/Key Considerations/Properties/etc.
- pjc-icon: svg icon, color, size, must consider reusability
- pjc-body: styling and flexibility
- pjc-title: (this is the banner part) flexibility for text, font, color, spacing
- pjc-scaff: (entire card including banner and body) size


### Check-in 2
- The group is individually splitting up the work with Liam working on the icon element, Liz working on the banner element, and Julian working on the body element.
- We're having issues with pushing our code to github for some reason but we can't figure out what's going wrong. It's something with husky but we aren't familiar with it so we've been struggling trying to put our code together.
- Next steps are looking towards troubleshooting with husky and finishing up bringing our pieces together.
